# FRC-2022-Shooter
A primitive shooter designed for FRC's Rapid React game in 2022, all mechanical components included (no fasteners or electronics). It was designed for a rectangular 26x26in swerve drivebase, powered by one Kraken X60.
It was originally created in SolidWorks but when I imported the assembly into OnShape the belly pan refused to load. Not sure why this is happening.

Here is a picture of what the belly pan looks like in Solidworks because it is far too late in the day for me to troubleshoot why OnShape is being weird
